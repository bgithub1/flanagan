This is a copy of Dr Michael Thomas Flanagan's Library
A large number of individuals have requested copies of this library. Consequently I have 
made it available, as a jar file (see below), with the qualifation that it is written 
to suport a course that I lecture. Though I believe it is professionally written, it is 
not a commercial product and the methods are not necessarily as all embracing as might be 
found in a commercial product nor are they checked to be fault free in all possible foreseable 
situations as would be, or at least ought to be, in a commercial product; you use this 
library at your own risk and more formally:
